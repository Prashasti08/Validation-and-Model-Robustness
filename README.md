# 🔍 Validation & Model Robustness: A Statistical Audit
**Ensuring Predictive Integrity through Diagnostic Replication in R**

### **🎯 The Challenge**
In predictive modeling, a high R-squared isn't enough. The goal of this project was to perform a rigorous **statistical audit** on an existing predictive model to determine its reliability, validity, and susceptibility to common statistical biases.

### **🛠️ Technical Methodology**
* **Model Replication:** Re-constructed linear regression models in **R** to verify initial findings and ensure reproducibility.
* **Diagnostic Auditing:** Conducted comprehensive checks for:
    * **Normality & Linearity:** Visualizing residuals to ensure the model captures underlying patterns.
    * **Homoscedasticity:** Testing for constant variance to prevent biased standard errors.
    * **Multicollinearity (VIF):** Identifying high correlations between predictors that could inflate variance.
* **Outlier Analysis:** Utilized Cook’s Distance and Leverage plots to identify influential data points that skewed model results.

### 🔑 **Technical Value Proposition**
This project demonstrates an advanced "Under-the-Hood" understanding of data science:
* **Beyond Prediction:** Shows the ability to critique a model's foundational assumptions, not just its output.
* **R Proficiency:** Advanced use of `ggplot2`, `car`, and base R's diagnostic suite for scientific reporting.
* **Data Integrity:** Proves a commitment to "Model Safety"—ensuring that business decisions are based on statistically sound evidence.

### **💡 Key Insights**
* **Bias Detection:** Identified specific diagnostic failures in the baseline model that led to overfitting.
* **Robustness Improvements:** Recommended data transformation and variable selection strategies to stabilize predictive accuracy.
* **Visual Communication:** Created diagnostic dashboards in R to communicate model health to stakeholders.
